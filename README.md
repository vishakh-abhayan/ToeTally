## How to Play

1. Open the game by visiting the deployed PWA URL or by running it locally.

2. The game starts with "X's turn." Click on an empty cell to make your move. The cell will be marked with "X" or "O," depending on the current player's turn.

3. The game will automatically detect when a player wins or when it's a draw.

4. To start a new game, click the "New Game" button.

5. The game can be installed as a PWA for offline access. Simply follow the browser's installation prompts.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

To install the game as a PWA, follow these steps:

1. Open the game in a supported browser.

2. Look for the browser's "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" option.

3. Follow the prompts to install the game as a PWA.
